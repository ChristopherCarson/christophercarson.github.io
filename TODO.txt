[X] Only allow for formatting the Thumby by erasing all files and re-uploading them, don't have separate button for reinstalling libs {only has a format button now}

[x] Make sure files are read in chunks so there is no memory allocation error (TinyDelver) {read in chunks now and collected by webpage}

[x] Investigate why when uploading firmware the Thumby device can't be reconnected without refreshing the page 
    (recreate? Put in BOOTSEL mode, download and drag-drop the .uf2, try to connect the Thumby 'Connect Thumby')
    {it's JUST fixed now with the new repl interaction}

[x] Double click files to open them (instinct for most people)

[x] Why can spamming the connect button quickly allow for some unwanted stuff to print to terminal? {Looks like two connect events stack in JS, rate limit connect button}

[x] Remove editor from editor list when closing editor {remove editor from list and remove editor related webpage storage variables(had to use timeout hack so browser doesn't cause delete)}

[x] let mouse click on panel focus that panel so widgets are added to that panel as a tab (more clean looking: https://github.com/golden-layout/golden-layout/issues/706)

[x] Clear and invert in bitmap builder do not save the state of the bitmap {Very easy fix, just add saveLocally to end of each function}

[x] Tie add widget buttons into adding each type of widget but limiting bitmap, shell, and FS to one each

[x] Tie in import and export of bitmap builder {each editor sets itself to a global last editor var and the bitmap builder uses that}

[x] FS and shell need the Thumby to connect again after either panel was closed and then added again {solved for now by refreshing the page so user know they have to reconnect}

[x] Powering off and then powering on the device will output extra garbage/intro message sometimes, not sure what caused this {caused by our main.py, I think, or something needs
    to catch this} {looks like power off then on interrupted main.py by disconnect and connect did not. Anyway, fixed by going to interrupt, raw and then normal instead}

[x] Why do helper programs sometimes get stuck on raw and need a newline? {Fixed by removing print('Done') on each thought was important but was not}

[x] Only usable with 2021-09-02 MP because of intro line {should be fixed by using indexOf and capturing the last common part of the line}

[x] Change title of editor on open file {uses the file path on the Thumby and no syncing will be done if file deleted on Thumby}

[x] When an editor is added, try to add it to the same panel as another editor? {Adds to editor, if any are open, with smallest ID (could make it the last selected)}

[x] Click the format button while the thumby is disconnected means will never be able to connect afterward {previous repl EOT fixes fixed this}

[x] Got rid of extra close button that was not in tab by modifying golden layout (line 2353) {if this was pressed, all editors would close under parent and not be deleted}

[x] If disconnected at just the right time, will freeze forever since a REPL EOT never gets its line {fixed by making forever loop dependent on disconnect flag}

[x] Full FS not retrieved when start main.py not connected and then connect {needed to do a soft reset like pyboard, https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/tools/pyboard.py}

[X] Able to use the terminal to input characters when Thumby is busy, need to only allow special ones like ctrl-c

[x] Tie in events for delete and rename file on Thumby and use new UI {both work and use uiKit library}

[x] Doing any operation during startup sequence will allow for garbage to be spit to terminal and for soft lock until power recycle/reconnect {fixed, busy flag was set false by readuntil function when it should not have been}

[x] Ensure file menu for delete, rename, new folder is force hidden since it will default to root if a folder is deleted therefore deleting everything

[x] Change from strictly a project structure to Thonny like access (allow editing game files and re saving them right away)
    but also keep the ability to make a 'New Game' and have it build the game file structure and then allow the same kind
    of access and saving
    [x] Make file dialog chooser for picking where file will be saved to on Thumby

[.] MAJOR: Very rarely during format it will hang and enter needs to be pressed {does this still happen? YES! Reproduce: Hard reset page, format Thumby, Open TinyDelver,
    save as test.py to TinyDelver, refresh page, connect thumby, save test.py, HANGS on raw!} {doesn't just happen when overwriting a file} {still happens...} {may just limit bytes sent}

[.] Do not allow typing into shell when RP2040 is busy {done, only ctrl-c is allowed through but might be a problem for MP programs that read stdin from shell. May need
    special flag that is BUSY for common operations and BUSY for custom user programs, is that possible?}

[x] Show little message in loading bar about what is loading {done}

[x] Do not allow for editors with the same file name to be opened, if you do, make it close the last one that was open with that name
    [x] During opening from Thumby
    [x] When saving to Thumby and picking a folder (new file or save as) need to check if a file with that path already is open

[x] Add inverted light theme to new UI

[x] Redo the file, view, and fast execute buttons {file, view are done but not fast execute} {All done now}

[x] Finish UI for Webpage4 with new layout and reconnect all events
	[X] Add 'Reset Page' option to reposition all panels without losing work/outputs
		[x] Why do editor backgrounds turn black on reset? {for some reason background z-index changes, just made editor in editor-dark.css have a matching black background too}
		[x] How to ensure panel constructors are not reloaded and then set to defaults therefore clearing people's work/outputs? {no easy way around this, just reload modded config and refresh page for now}
    [X] Why do the Bitmap Builder buttons stay highlighted in red? {CSS in uikit had had focus element that made it stay red, got rid of it}
    [x] Add loading bar that can be used for common operations

[x] Fast execute button doesn't do anything {now it does}

[x] Add 'report bugs' button to GitHub (when there is one) {one under 'other links' and leads to tinycircuits.github.io for now}

[x] Add back brief tooltips for all buttons and some UI elements {make sure to keep adding these for all new ui elements}

[.] Add Beta to IDE in top needs actual font for 'beta'

[.] Scrolling in editor can be slow {depends on extensions installed and what they do the site. Profile with Performance -> start record ctrl-e -> look at how long tasks take, probably an extension}

[ ] Enabled Ace live auto completion and editor ext lang tools file for exact match only

[ ] Clicked buttons lose their border

[ ] Reset layout does not re-add an editor, maybe it shouldn't

[ ] Sometimes when opening files it won't get past raw then the next file to open will be replaced by the default code (very rare and old bug)

[ ] Disable certain buttons if their actions are not usable at certain moments

[ ] Make editor dropdown buttons need to be clicked so they are not in the way too often

[ ] Running a program from the shell and then typing random characters that do not get consumed means an interrupt can't happen through shell or utility functions (power cycle ahs to be done)

[ ] Show user a warning when the port is likely in use already or just show manual choosers or when using MAKE A NEW GAME

[ ] Display little messages on Thumby when the Thumby is busy
    [ ] Need to make sure thumby.py is on Thumby before using it for status messages for screen

[ ] In the DIR chooser, show a waring that an overwrite is going to happen on the Thumby, might also make it possible to select file and overwrite directly
    as well as use the current editors path as default path

[ ] REPL:
    [ ] Random hanging on raw could have been because of sending too many bytes at a time: https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/tools/pyboard.py#L444
    [ ] Some commands are not sent in 256 byte blocks and may exceed this. The size of the command should be accounted for as well as the extra data
    [ ] Can verify right away if a command worked or not, prints OK to raw if worked, right away or after small amount of time, could retry
        https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/tools/pyboard.py#L450
    [x] Hard reset page, format thumby, open lib/thumby.py, refresh page, try to save thumby.py and it will hang on raw until a ctrl-c is given {detected this and made lame fix}

[ ] When disconnected and save button pressed, don't toggle save * in tab and make sure to give a pop-up that it was not saved

[ ] When accessing a file and a program is running, interrupt program first so file can be accessed without first stopping the program manually

[ ] Emulator: Use button on screen to hold dpad down updates quicker than holding keyboard key down

[ ] Emulator: Need four center buttons so user can use mouse to go diagonal

[ ] Make sure to change and test server file retrieval in editor wrapper examples and repl formatting when names change


[ ] Get binary data into correct format in JS and send to MP (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47215327/how-do-i-convert-a-string-in-javascript-to-a-sequence-of-bytes)

[.] Rare emulator bug where changes do not end up in flash (I guess)
    [x] Looked into it, variable for collecting serial data was not reset between runs and 'may' fix the problem (hard to replicate)

[x] Optimize emulator by turning opcodes if-else chain into switch blocks

[x] Revert changes to repl file upload, line endings are not correct
